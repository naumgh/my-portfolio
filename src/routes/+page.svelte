    export let summary = "I'm Naum Hoffman, a recent computer science graduate from the University of Victoria, currently based in Seattle, WA. My journey into tech started with creative building in games like Minecraft and evolved into real-world problem solving through Python and Java. Iâ€™ve worked as a data analyst at Pamway Logistics, where I aligned academic insights with business outcomes, and gained international experience in Macedonia that pushed me out of my comfort zone and helped me grow professionally. Outside of work, I stay grounded through fitness, camping in the Cascades and Olympic Peninsula, and volunteer work with the SCA restoring native ecosystems. I'm always learning, building, and looking for ways to make a meaningful impact."
